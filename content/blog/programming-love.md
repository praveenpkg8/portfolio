People out there who are zero in tech could start with a simple programming language. My choice of language can be bias since I am partial towards specific languages. Pick a language of choice, but my preference would be.

1. C
2. Python
3. Go

I have some basic knowledge of these languages, sharing my thoughts of why someone should know this. My suggestion can be a changing in future. But learning a new language gives a new perspective.

Before discussing the pros and cons of the language, I like to share the main concepts someone has to check out on any programming languages.

* Basic data types
* Conditional construct
* Iterations
* File Operations
* Exceptional Handling
* Object-Oriented Concepts (if language offers)

## C

Provides with proper textbook syntax Fundamentals of any language could be traced back to this one. Anyone pursuing this could adopt any other programming language. To get how hard it is to code someone as to start writing in C

## Python

Simple language anyone can pick up within a week. Practicing the language would offer you tons of features. Start from basic scripting to advance machine learning. Dynamic errors are so prone to this particular language if someone not cautious about what they write.

## Go

Know for its concurrency. The buzz of the future. It is a collaboration of c and python
