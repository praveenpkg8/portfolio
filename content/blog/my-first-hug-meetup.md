HashiCorp meetup after a long time. I was hesitant to attend this meet up at first. Guess what once I finished attending this meetup, I learnt a hell lot and got new networks in devops field. Meetup initially started with what they have been in the past. Team of young developers who wanted to bring entire HashiCorp HUG community back with a huge potential.

   
**Ram Kumar and Karthik** from **CODA global** wanted to bring HashiCorp community to a great extent. So they called for a new event on september 28, 2019. The HUG meetup started like this. As fresher in the field of development I only knew very little about cloud itself. I was playing around GCP for my practice and in my organization also they were relying on GCP.  
These guys said how an organization would require multi dependant cloud base when they scale up. Multi dependant cloud base is nothing much having more than one cloud providers. They explained the use case how it is difficult for both the developer and operations team to handle a code base in multi cloud environment.  
Use case of the meetup was well explained with in the first thirty of the meetup. Once we understood why we as developer or operation guy would require HashiCorp product to maintain a multi Cloud based environment. They were explaining about **HashiConf19** and their latest release.  
Next Session was handled by Madan who was a devops guy at CODA global.He with the help of the demo god gave detailed session on how to deploy cloud function and test them with kitchen and inspec in google cloud platform. He was very patient and well detailed in his explanation. As always in a demo session in was a hello world function written in python. He gave insights how to runt our gcloud cloud function using terraform.  
After him Ram Kumar one of the co-organizer of the event taught how to design a proper Golden AMI Pipeline with Packer and Inspec. Packer was one of the products of HashiCorp. 

> HashiCorp Packer is easy to use and automates the creation of any type of machine image. It embraces modern configuration management by encouraging you to use automated scripts to install and configure the software within your Packer-made images. Packer brings machine images into the modern age, unlocking untapped potential and opening new opportunities.

  
This was the definition given by HashiCorp, the reason I am posting this out is I never worked on Jenkins and AMI, may be once I learn them in future I can change in this section. Sorry Ram Kumar if you are reading this I was able to understand what you did but I don't have knowledge to pen it down right Now may be I would update it in future.  
This was all my take about HashiCorp first HUG meetup and thanks for having a potential meetup.
